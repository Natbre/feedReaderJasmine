## Intro 

The project is made along with the Udacity as a project during a Nanodeegree Scholarship. It uses the JAsmine to test the Javascript code.

# Udacity intro to the project

In this project you are given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, they've already included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and even started writing their first test suite! Unfortunately, they decided to move on to start their own company and we're now left with an application with an incomplete test suite. That's where you come in.
